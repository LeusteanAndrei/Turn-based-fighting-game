# Project description
I made a working and functional class structure for a turn based fighting game ( similar to Fate/Grand Order and Honkai Star rail games ). At the moment everything is done through command line interface but in the future a 
GUI will be implemented for smoother sailing and nicer animations.
<sub> the attack part of the game is not yet done, because I didn't want to simply put a basic attack so for now it just passes the turn </sub>
